# SmartContract_CMUVolunteer
A smart contract that enables students to monetize the work done by them.

We want to track, validate and reward student activities within the campus.
By activities, we mean any activity that a student undertakes within the campus or representing the university outside. Some examples of these activities include the student mentorship program, participating in student club activities, etc.

There are two kind of rewards that students will receive for recording these activities. One is ability to prove that they performed the activities
and the second is getting CMU coins which they might use to get vouchers.

Right now students perform these activities and list some of them in their resumes. Companies test if they have performed these activities during the interview process or during background checks while making the offer. We want to achieve two major objectives with our smart contract.
1. Provide an incentive to students to track and record their activities on the blockchain and Help companies verify these student activities easily
2. There are three key stakeholders in this use case. They are students, CMU, and companies. In the next section, we will discuss each stake-holderâ€™s benefits separately

Following are the actions that the stakeholders will perform and their incentives for performing those actions.
1. Students: Students will record the activities they perform on the blockchain. There are two incentives for them to do this. One, they will be able to prove to companies that they performed a specific activity. Two, they will get CMU coins for recording each activity. They can use these coins later to get vouchers.
2. CMU: CMU will exchange CMU coins for providing vouchers to students. Their primary incentive is to boost student activity on the campus.
3. Companies: Companies will validate student activities in the blockchain.Their incentive is that it will reduce both the time and cost of validating activities listed by students in their resumes.
